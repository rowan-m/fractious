## Running the demo locally

[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/). In this directory, run:

```
npm ci
```

Start the server using:

```
npm start
```

The server will run on a random port which will be shown in the console.

If you're developing, then there is a task to start the server in development
mode on port 8080.

```
npm run start:dev
```
